# AP CSP Code Stash
This is my 2019-2020 School Year AP CSP code stash. A series of fun mini-projects mostly written in python!

Some programs require libraries not included in the Python standard library. To run those programs, create a virtual environment and install the libraries indicated in requirements.txt
